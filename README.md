 ## BDD
 - The page requests for three numbers which represents the three sides of a triangle
 
 - The submit button triggers the function to analyse the data
 
 - The back end of the triangle tracker runs the data to determine whether it is a equilateral ,scalene,isoceles or not a triangle and displays the output in form of an alert. 
 
## Description
The triangle tracker is used to calculate whether a triangle is isosceles,equilateral,scalene or not a triangle.A scalene does not have all sides equal,a equilateral all sides are equal so input all three values to be the same,an isosceles two sides are equal so put two same values and one not same ."GIT CLONE URL" "cd", "atom" .,"code"...
this is my second i.p in prep class its a project about a triangle trackler..helps the user determine the type of triangle the values inputted.its free for any user to use,its a better way to calculator.
